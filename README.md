## Project Description

The Common Thorax Disease Detector, is a web app that has a highly trained deep-learning model that classifies x-ray images, reducing the need for a radiologist to examine them. It is for medical professionals and patients who upload x-ray chest images the Med-X AI app is an application that uses deep neural network models that will detect common chest health issues rather than having to wait for a radiologist to examine x-ray images that are not a priority for them. Our application will reduce the time it takes for a patient to receive their diagnosis by using AI.

The application uses neural network models that will detect common chest health issues, allowing radiologists to spend less time reading X-rays. This will reduce the time it takes for a patient to receive their diagnosis through the use of AI.
